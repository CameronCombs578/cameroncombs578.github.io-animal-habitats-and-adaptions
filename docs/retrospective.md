# What went well
During the creation stage of the project's repository, I was able to effectivley publish my repository online using GitHub after past failures. Learning from these failures and following the exact steps to publish on GitHub made the project possible.
# What went wrong
When I was creating the plan.md file for the docs folder, I faced an issue. I was finding difficulties in creating a schedule for my project because it caused me to schedule the rest of my tasks and commitments I had made. Thankfully, I was able to schedule all my responsabilities and leave room for publishing my project.
# what I would do differently
For future projects, I hope to plan my tasks ahead of time so that I am not caught off guard when I have to complete any assignments. Also, planning ahead of time will help me to not make more commitments than I can handle.
