        <p class="normal-text">The world is full of various kinds of animals that live in the most interesting environments. These creatures have many categories. However, the most common ones used include mammals, reptiles, fish, birds, and amphibians. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that are known for their hairy bodies. Reptiles are creatures that have survived many changes in the world’s environment and normally have dry and/or rough skin. Fish are aquatic creatures that are cold-blooded and can breathe underwater. Birds are creatures with beaks and/or can fly in the air. Amphibians are vertebrate animals that can alter the temperature of their own bodies. </p>
        <p class="normal-text">These creatures are spread out throughout nature and have many interesting abilities enabling them to live in unique environments such as rain forests, deserts, and caves. Each continent has its own selection of animals. In this website, animals’ adaptions and habitats are discussed with detail. Listed below is a link to a page that discusses the habitats and adaptations of multiple animals that live in the Americas. </p>
