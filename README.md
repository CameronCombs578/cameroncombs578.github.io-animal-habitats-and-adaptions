# Animal Habitats and Adaptions 
# Introduction 
This project focusses on presenting viewers with a website discussing information on animals that live in various locations on the planet. 
## Purpose 
This project's purpose is to provide my audience with accurate and interesting information about specific animals and their habitats on a multi-page website. 
## Design 
This project is built from **HTML** and **CSS** code, which allows the website to present its information in a well-structured manner. Also, this project is managed on a **GitHub** repository. This enables the project to be quickly edited based on feedback and errors.
